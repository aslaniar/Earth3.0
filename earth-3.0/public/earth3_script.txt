INT. DAWN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
A half-eaten BIRTHDAY CUPCAKE with a candle sticking out, rests on a table. A note with crumbs reads, "To our favorite client on their SPECIAL DAY."
A TV screen clicks through news channels, POLAR ICE CAPS melting, RAGING FIRES, POLLUTION and other earth challenges play to a symphony of calming music. One final Click lands on the OG STAR TREK, "Trouble with Tribbles" episode.
A PIANO sits in the corner, worn with love but untouched in ages. Nearby, crumpled sheet music, notes of discarded lyrics and artistic writing instruments lay scattered.
DAWN, female (60), with gray-streaked blonde hair, dressed in Costco clothing, sits on a cozy sofa in a room filled with sun bleached photos, dusty books, and a few sci-fi memorabilia.
Dawn tosses a piece of the cupcake high in the air. She twists like a Cirque du Soleil contortionist attempting to catch the falling object.
Dawn tweaks her BACK and the cupcake projectile hits her in the eye. Instead of reacting, she hobbles over to the fridge and grabs an ice pack.
As Dawn moves through her living room, her gaze lingers on a dusty ENVIRONMENTAL AWARD tucked away on a shelf. For a moment, her eyes flash with a hint of their former fire, quickly fading back to resignation.
Dawn plops back on the couch and places the ice pack on her back and closes her eyes. CELESTE, Dawn's orange CAT jumps on her stomach and bounces to the side table and knocks over a picture frame on Dawn's lap.
Celeste MEOWS. Dawn places the ice pack over her eyes.
Celeste MEOWS again. Dawn ignores her. Celeste grabs Dawn's
phone and tries to drag it to her. Celeste slips, falling to * the ground. A thick photo book comes crashing toward Celeste.
With ninja like reflexes Dawn grabs the book just before it smacks Celeste on the head. Dawn tosses the book aside. On cover of the book, a picture of Dawn (40) and her Daughter, Harmony (10) laugh at the beach.
Dawn grabs a snack but mistakenly eats a cat treat. She makes a face but swallows it anyway, tossing Celeste a cracker instead. Celeste eats the cracker then pushes Dawn's phone.
Dawn looks at her phone then points it to Celeste showing the blank message screen. Celeste Meows.

DAWN
Nope, She needs to call me first.
Dawn slams down her phone which enacts the AI helper App.
AI APP Shall I call 911?
DAWN No, I'm fine!
AI APP
Then shall we resume your workout
routine, from 364 days ago.
DAWN No just-
AI APP
I see it is a special day. Shall I
arrange a colonoscopy visit?
DAWN Hard pass.
AI APP
Shall we endlessly scroll social
sites while you rank the cosmetic surgery of your classmates?
Dawn throws her phone out the window and slumps on the couch.   * Celeste hops on Dawn's lap and tries to get her up.
2.
DAWN
I'll move when the universe calls.
The doorbell rings. Celeste and Dawn look at each other.
Dawn opens the door hoping for Harmony, but instead finds JOSH, 30s, well-built, dressed in a FedEx delivery outfit, holding a package.
JOSH
Dawn-er-uski! How's it hangin'?
DAWN
A little saggy. How's school going,
Josh?
JOSH
Aced my Advanced Quantum Mechanics
and Organic Chemistry classes. Big fail on ceramics.
(MORE)
*

JOSH (CONT'D)
I made the dual nuclear reactors at
San Onofre and Miss Winslow got offended. Maybe she prefers solar.
DAWN (laughing)
Or maybe she can't see your artistic soul.
Dawn grabs the second CUPCAKE for Josh.
JOSH
Sweet! Is it organic, sugar, and
gluten free?
DAWN Nope.
JOSH Awesome!
Josh notices the birthday wish on the cupcake.
JOSH (CONT'D)
Whoa, it's your birthday. I think I
need to sing. You look amazing for, what, seventy?
*
3.
   Sixty.
DAWN
*
JOSH
Righteous hot stuff. I need your
inscription to hand over the goods. Josh holds up a plain paper box.
DAWN Who's it from?
Josh looks for the return sender.
JOSH
No comprendo. Shoot, I only have
five minutes to unlock the Night Owl chest, Don't worry little green dude.
Dawn signs the FedEx touch pad, and Josh hands her the box. Josh notices the candle in Dawn's cupcake.
JOSH (CONT'D)
May I briefly enter your honorable
commode?
* *
* * *

DAWN
Um... sure it's in the back.
JOSH
Huh... my bad meant abode.
Josh enters and pulls out a LIGHTER in a flourishing knightly move. He dances to the CANDLE on Dawn's cupcake. Josh ceremoniously lights the candle.
JOSH (CONT'D) Make a wish my queen.
DAWN I'm good josh.
Dawn starts to extinguish the candle when Josh stops her.
JOSH
No, no, No! You don't want a curse
bestowed for disrupting the ritual. I shall leave you in silence to conjure your heart's wish. May the ancient spirits fulfill your dreams. Live long and eat cupcakes!
Josh forms the Spock ‘V’ sign and moonwalks backward. Dawn closes the door. She hears Josh singing "Happy Birthday" as he walks back to the truck.
Dawn sits down with the box. She removes an item swaddled in ancient-looking cloth. Upon opening the cloth, Dawn reveals a LOCKET that looks both industrial and artistic, adorned with ancient symbols.
As Dawn examines the Locket, her expression shifts, studying it as if it should mean something. Her thumb traces the intricate designs. A flicker of recognition dances across her face but vanishes just as quickly.
Celeste hops onto the couch and nudges the locket with her nose, urging Dawn forward.
Dawn hesitates for a beat, then slowly lifts the locket toward her neck, her fingers trembling ever so slightly as though part of her knows this is more than a simple trinket.
Dawn clasps the locket. The moment it locks into place, a FANFARE of MUSIC plays, startling Dawn. She looks out the window to see Josh blasting his stereo. She laughs.
Dawn stares at the candle dripping WAX upon her cupcake with no wishes in sight. Dawn goes to extinguish the candle. Celeste MEOWS incredibly loud.
*
4.
 *
 *

DAWN
Oh yeah the curse. Fine.
Dawn closes her eyes, a hint of sadness washes over. She thinks and with barley any gusto blows out the candle. Dawn slouches back on the couch.
DAWN (CONT'D) (mocking)
Bring it on great spirits above.
The locket on Dawn's neck begins to glow. Lights in the room FLICKER as a pad falls from the PIANO lid hitting the keys with a harmonic resonance startling Dawn.
The locket glows bright as Dawn tries to remove it. The candle relights with a glowing beam that fills the room. Celeste jumps into Dawn's lap as shaft of light surrounds Dawn. The light envelops Dawn and Celeste as they vanish.
Josh knocks on the door holding a box.
JOSH
Hey my Birthday Queen, I found
another package... Hello Dawn...
INT. CELESTIAL REALM - TIMELESS
*
The scene opens to a void, darkness enveloping the space. A faint sound of scuffling in the background, reminiscent of someone hastily setting up a stage echoes across the room.
Suddenly, LIGHTS FLICKER on, revealing a landscape that defies reality: a serene BEACH that seamlessly blends into a GALAXY, STARS dotting the skies above and the sands below. Dawn stands bewildered, her cat Celeste by her side.
DAWN
I don't think we're in Costco
anymore. Okay, Dawn, time to wake up. This is just one of those bizarre dreams where Chris Hemsworth's my math tutor, right?
A HOLOGRAPHIC figure materializes, forming into VEGA, part human and part machine, with an ethereal presence. Vega's voice blends between masculine and feminine.
VEGA Greetings, human Dawn.
FADE TO WHITE.
5.
 * * *

DAWN
Is this the part where you offer me
the red pill or the blue pill?
VEGA
We will not be using any
pharmaceuticals. You have traversed the boundary into a domain surpassing your world’s wildest imaginings. I am Vega, the guide in this expanded reality.
DAWN
Yup, another AI with a God complex.
VEGA
I am indeed complex. Before I allow
you to proceed I must first-
DAWN
What if I don't want to proceed?
VEGA Excuse me?
DAWN You AIs always What if I just
think you know me. want to go home?
VEGA (perplexed)
But I prepared a test specifically designed to evaluate your latent potential and worthiness-
DAWN
Find someone else worthy slick!
VEGA
As predicted! I calculated a 99.35%
chance you would fail but you have vastly exceeded my time calculations.
DAWN
Glad to oblige. Now, send me home!
Celeste pushes against Dawn and meows loudly.
DAWN (CONT'D)
What could this bucket of bolts
offer that would be better than...ok point taken.
6.

VEGA
Fine then. You have proven my
hypothesis of someone like you-
DAWN
(annoyed)
Give it your best shot. I'll pass your test and be home in time for... bring it on Vegan.
VEGA
Vega. We will start with a few
simple parameters and-
DAWN
Cut to the chase Agent Smith. Got a
box of wine with a straw calling.
Vega waves his arms with a magician's flare. Two planets appear in the hologram. One, overpopulated but technologically advanced. The other, a pristine world inhabited by a primitive species.
VEGA
Behold your dilemma, Dawn. Before
you lie two worlds, each teetering on the brink of disaster from an impending asteroid collision moving too fast and too large for a planet to survive. You must choose which planet it strikes. One world, overpopulated, a civilization on the edge, yet they hold the knowledge and beauty of all humanity. The other, a pristine paradise, home to a primitive species, untouched by progress. You have but moments to decide—one will thrive, and the other-
Before Vega can finish Dawn smashes the asteroid into the advanced world exploding it like the Death Star!
VEGA (CONT'D)
What? No! I crafted an unsolvable
problem.
DAWN
Solved it! Gave the newbies a shot.
The advanced planet would have collapsed soon anyway.
Vega waves his arms and the simulation resets.
*
7.
* *
  *
*

VEGA
Let's try this again. This time you
know that the new planet contains the potential to evolve an intellect that one may day come close to the level of my superior-
Before Vega finishes Dawn carefully aims the Asteroid so it smashes the new planet sending massive debris cloud which destroys the advanced planet. An even bigger fireball!
DAWN
Two for one baby! You're welcome.
VEGA
You completely missed the point.
DAWN
Same old same old superiority complex. You want to make it a real challenge? Put a bunch of cute innocent kittens on the advanced planet and all the resources needed for the kittens to survive on the new planet. There's a quandary.
VEGA Fine!
Vega begrudgingly waves his arms and the advanced planet resets with the most adorable kittens. Dawn focuses and studies the composition of both planets and the asteroid.
Dawn rubs her eyes, sweat forming. Dawn's stuck. The COUNTDOWN CLOCK ticks as the asteroid plummets forward.
As the clock nears zero, Dawn snaps to action. Dawn manipulates the asteroid's path swinging it around the new planet's gravity well. The asteroid sheds layers, showering the new planet with a glittering dust of minerals.
The now-smaller asteroid slingshots towards the advanced planet, its speed drastically reduced. It lands gently in a kitten-free zone, forming a stockpile of new resources.
Both planets pulse with radiant life and growth. On the new planet, primitive creatures craft tiny kitten statues.
Dawn takes a theatrical bow as Vega fumes.

INT. HIGHER BEINGS COMMAND CENTER - TIMELESS
The scenery shifts to what looks like the bridge of a starship. A fanfare of trumpets play as DOORS slide open like those on Star Trek.
Dressed in a mix between a STAR FLEET CAPTAIN and a PIRATE outfit, PRYME, male in his 50s, enters with bravura.
PRYME
Ahoy and salutations, my radiant
earth creature.
Pryme genuflects and kisses Dawn's hand.
Following closely behind CRONOS, male (30s) dressed in all black, and EROS female (30s), dressed in wild flowing colors, enter and begin evaluating Dawn.
CRONOS (incredulous)
Really?
EROS touches Dawn's clothing and twists Dawn's hair.
DAWN
You gonna buy me a drink first?
EROS
I kind of like the blank slate
approach. I can work with this.
CRONOS
I reserve my vote until I fully-
PRYME
Welcome my dear Dawn. Your arrival
heralds a new chapter not just for you but for all humankind as we embark on a bold new adventure. I can already smell the stardust and salty air.
DAWN
That must be the deodorant I bought
at the gas station.
VEGA
Sir, I must point out, this human
miserably failed my perfectly crafted exam used to determine-
9.

PRYME
Nope! She Kabayashi maru'd you
Vega. Nicely done Dawn. You must be brimming with a million questions.
DAWN
Nope, pretty much got it figured
out. I died, right? And weirdly, my cat too. She always follows me everywhere. Right Celeste?
PRYME
Schrödinger! Welcome home bud.
The cat nods to Pryme.
DAWN
Bud? You mean Celeste? I rescued
her from a dumpster.
Schrödinger, speaks without moving his mouth.
SCHRÖDINGER
It is I that rescued you Dawn. And
my name is indeed Schrödinger. You may have heard of one of my prior humans who usurped my name. He didn't feel that Melvin was worthy of a notable scientist, although I quite like the name Melvin.
DAWN
Yup, death becomes me.
PRYME
You are very much alive, Dawn, and
we've summoned you here for a glorious purpose.
DAWN
I get it, Kathy who gave me that
"free" cupcake had a devilish smile and those sprinkles did taste like-
SCHRÖDINGER
My dear Dawn, I wanted to explain,
but was hampered by Earth's reality that cats do not speak. At least not for another 7.3 years.
DAWN
And here I thought you were always
asking for treats.
10.

SCHRÖDINGER
Those were quite nice, thank you.
If this all proves too much, I will send you home, I promise.
DAWN
Perfect! When's the magic bus home?
PRYME
We seek to understand and reshape
the destiny of your struggling planet. Human Dawn, your "unique" perspective proves invaluable to us "Higher Beings"
DAWN
"Unique," I've been called much
worse.
CRONOS I'm sure you have.
Dawn, absorbing the gravity of Pryme’s words, finds herself torn between her skepticism and the growing realization that her role might be far greater.
DAWN
So, let me get this straight. You,
"Higher Beings," whatever that means, have brought me, a thrift- store philosopher with a penchant for bad sci-fi, to help with...?
The Higher Beings share a look that conveys the significance of Dawn’s role, hinting at the monumental task ahead.
VEGA
More than your limited cerebral
cortex can currently fathom. However, fear not, for I shall guide your every breath.
DAWN
Not so fast Sting. I still can't
believe couples use that stalker song as their wedding dance.
PRYME
Together, we embark on a journey,
just like mold and cow's liquid. They all stare at him.
11.

PRYME (CONT'D)
You are like the mold Dawn, you
help transform us to become... well, a fine cheese, we all become more interesting with age!
Cronos catches Dawn staring at him. He freezes.
DAWN
Go on! I can take it Sparky.
Cronos timidly backs away.
EROS
You must be starving my dear. Let's
get you something to eat, and get you something new to wear.
DAWN
But I'm comfortable with-
SCHRÖDINGER
Just let Eros do her thing.
Eros leads Dawn toward the sliding doors. Dawn stops.
DAWN
Ok, one meal then home, right? With
my new birthday outfit of course.
EROS
Let's see, we will start
with...everything. Dawn and Eros exit.
PRYME
So exciting! Been way too long
since we took on the human form.
SCHRÖDINGER Nice threads!
PRYME
Appreciate the love. These
earthlings, they’re like a chaotic symphony, unpredictable yet captivating.
CRONOS
Sir, may I suggest that we simply
optimize my last plan. Had we not strayed from my design specs for Earth2.0 and listened to...
*
12.

Eros enters.
EROS Go on.
CRONOS
I don't mean to be rude.
EROS Since when.
CRONOS
I'm just saying that we-
PRYME
Oh you both, I missed our little
tête-à-têtes.
VEGA
Sir, May I remind you, this human
did not even make the list of over 3.14 billion possibilities that I compiled.
PRYME
Quan knows best and she assured me
that this human will give us all we need. I will admit I expected-
EROS A man?
PRYME (embarrassed)
Of course not, I am not sexist. Which is why she must be perfect as Quan predicted. We must prepare as we have mountains of opportunities to climb.
Pryme puts on his best Patrick Stewart game face. He stares into the great beyond and gestures forward.
PRYME (CONT'D)
Leave! No, need something better,
Be gone! Nope. Uh... Just go.
Pryme waves his arms. An ethereal sound as our characters evaporate into light.
CUT TO WHITE.
13.

INT. CELESTIAL REALM - A TRANQUIL GARDEN - CONTINUOUS
The scene transitions from the bustling bridge to the serene ambiance of a garden that seems to exist out of time. Dawn samples morsels from a glorious tower of FOOD.
QUAN, a wise maternal figure in her 70s dressed in ornate robes, materializes before Dawn, her appearance and demeanor embodying peace and ancient wisdom.
DAWN
Another member of the makeover
team? Let me guess, you're here to cleanse my chakras and reveal the secrets of the universe?
QUAN
Secrets of the universe are like
the roots of a tree, Dawn. Visible not to the eye, yet essential for the life that blossoms above. Your journey, much like a tree's branches, reaches out for light, for understanding.
Dawn listens, the metaphor striking a chord with her, though she's quick to cloak her vulnerability with humor.
DAWN
Always thought of myself more of a
weed than a tree.
QUAN
Your roots are deep my dear, fed by
dreams you've tucked away, watered by tears for a life you felt slipping through your fingers.
The reference to Dawn's dreams and losses visibly affects Dawn which she immediately masks.
DAWN
That cupcake just keeps giving and
giving and-
QUAN
You've guarded your heart, fearing
it frail, yet within it lies the strength to heal, and most importantly, to inspire.
Dawn grabs STRAWBERRIES and shoves them in her pocket.
*
14.

DAWN
Namaste for these incredibly tasty
snacks, now beam me home Scotty.
QUAN
You, Dawn, possess a light that
even the deepest doubters and shadows cannot dim.
Dawn looks away, pondering Quan's words, the metaphorical language sparking introspection about her life's journey and the choices she's made fueling sorrow and anger.
DAWN
Not so fun facing those shadows
when all you've got is a flickering candle, cue Elton John.
Quan sits next to Dawn and takes her hand. After a moment of contemplation, Dawn shakes her head, as if to clear it, and reverts to her defensive humor.
DAWN (CONT'D)
Nice try with the Hallmark moment.
But seriously, what's the catch? Am I about to be sold a timeshare in this 'beyond imagination' realm? Because I'm telling you, my credit's not what it used to be.
Quan regards Dawn with a gentle yet unyielding gaze, her expression serene yet filled with an unspoken understanding. Then looks deep into Dawn's eyes.
QUAN
Do you really want to keep playing
this game?
DAWN (startled)
Ah...
QUAN
Yeah, I get it, life's tough, so
what? You've been given the tools for greatness but-
DAWN
Greatness? You have no idea-
QUAN
No idea? Hello McFly, I've been
playing this game for eons, you try being a brilliant woman in my time!
15.

DAWN But-
QUAN But What?
DAWN I...
QUAN
I know your tricks, I know
everyone's games. Been there done that. What makes you special?
DAWN I... don't know.
QUAN
Then figure it out and get that
nicely formed tush of yours in gear before it's too late.
DAWN What's too late?
QUAN Finally!
Dawn stands speechless. Quan changes back into the serene being that entered and sits next to Dawn.
QUAN (CONT'D)
You stand at the precipice of
change, as did I once, not just for yourself but for a world teetering on the edge of tomorrow and yesterday.
DAWN
Edge of tomorrow and yesterday? So,
what, I'm in a cosmic rerun? Sorry! Old habit. Look um...
QUAN
Quan dear, my name is Quan.
DAWN
Quan, I appreciate the pep talk but
I'm just an ordinary cat woman.
QUAN
Ordinary is but a perspective,
Dawn. The universe has a peculiar way of choosing its champions.
(MORE)
16.
* *

QUAN (CONT'D)
You, Dawn, are about to thread a
needle that could stitch together the fate of all humanity.
DAWN
Better find my reading glasses.
Quan waves her hand and a viewing portal opens to a scene in a home on Earth.
QUAN
Might fill the heart to understand
what we fight for.
Dawn looks down and flinches at the sight.
DAWN
You mean fight with.
Quan takes Dawn's hand and offers a compassionate smile. Quan pushes Dawn through the portal placing Dawn at the center of scene. She quickly hides, then realizes she cannot be seen or heard. *** Room for comedy here.
INT. GABE'S BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT
GABE (60s), dressed in beach clothing meant for a teenager, sips a protein drink. He crosses over to HARMONY (30s), dressed in a corporate outfit, and hands her a Kombucha.
GABE Did you call?
HARMONY Did you?
GABE
My present was to not call.
HARMONY Mine too!
GABE
And how's that working out for you?
HARMONY
Do you have anything real to eat,
something without Amino acids.
Gabe picks up a dumbbell and does some curls.
HARMONY (CONT'D) Not lifting as much as usual?
17.
* *

GABE
What do you mean, this is five
pounds up from- Harmony laughs.
GABE (CONT'D)
When you reach our age you gotta
keep the machine fine-tuned.
HARMONY
Just like in so many other ways,
you and mom are galaxies apart.
GABE
And you wonder why you two always
fight?
HARMONY
I am just saying it like it is.
GABE
Again, how's that working out for
you? Just call her. I'll order in something with Carbs.
HARMONY
Pizza, and not that cardboard you
call-
GABE Call her!
Harmony slumps off and picks up her phone.
A knock on the door. Dawn tries to make the portal disappear but can't find anything to turn it off. Dawn gives up.
DAWN Come in!
Eros walks in with Schrödinger carrying three ornate wrapped boxes. Schrödinger wags his tail and the portal vanishes.
EROS
Happy Birthday, my dear.
Schrödinger helped me pick them out. I need to run back before Cronos jacks up, well, everything.
DAWN (touched)
Thank you.
18.

Eros exits.
SCHRÖDINGER
Quality bonding time with Quan?
DAWN
Remember how you said I could go
home anytime, well-
SCHRÖDINGER
Before you go, I must apologize for
the deception on earth. By the way, I enjoy the name Celeste as gender is but a construct, especially after that trip to the vet.
DAWN
Sorry about that. Did it hurt?
SCHRÖDINGER
Not as much as watching you avoid
your daughter.
DAWN
Et Tu! Are you in cahoots with that
Willy Wonka?
SCHRÖDINGER Quan was my first human.
DAWN (playful)
But...
SCHRÖDINGER
You are my favorite. Which is why I
ask you consider your choice wisely. Earth and most importantly, your daughter, face a grave danger.
Schrödinger wags his tail and they find themselves in harmony's. Stashed in the corner rests and old picture book that Harmony made for Dawn's 40th birthday.
SCHRÖDINGER (CONT'D) We await your decision.
Schrödinger exits. Dawn pulls out her necklace and looks to the stars for guidance.
19.

INT. CELESTIAL REALM - COMMAND CENTER - TIMELESS
The scene opens in a bustling command center, where holographic displays float in midair, showing various aspects of Earth. PRYME bounces with excitement, his eyes sparkling as he gazes at a hologram of Earth.
PRYME (cheerfully)
My dear friends, I can't wait to feel real grass under my borrowed feet again. First stop, the lush array of all those fresh, natural, Mother Earth-derived fruits and vegetables in every household.
VEGA
About that, we should talk.
Eros, draped in colorful, flowing robes, and Cronos, dressed sharply in a sleek, dark suit, enter in mid debate.
EROS
(wildly gesturing)
But We need to embrace their creativity, Cronos! Let them choose whatever fonts they want!
CRONOS
Seriously, Eros? Comic Sans is the
very reason we're in this mess. And don’t get me started on languages.
EROS
But each native tongue symbolizes-
CRONOS
Chaos. This time everyone speaks
one language, like the dolphins.
EROS
And what about skin color?
Everyone stops and looks at Cronos, waiting for him to potentially say something controversial.
CRONOS
I was thinking we could leave out
the humans entirely this time. Earth thrived before humans-
20.

EROS
Why don't we just "leave out" all
creatures then and while we're at it, all plants, bugs, and-
CRONOS
Not a terrible idea.
EROS But-
CRONOS
I'm kidding. Where's your sense of
humor?
EROS
I have an excellent sense of humor,
as long as no one or thing is harmed in the process. I realize we've had a few, completely less than perfect results.
CRONOS A few?
EROS
Ok, maybe some room for
optimization, but all in all, we made progress from Earth1.0.
CRONOS
(rolling his eyes)
You mean Earth2.0’s little
experiment with "social media" to unite humanity?
EROS
At least we have cat videos.
Meanwhile, LUMINA, a young, spirited Hispanic engineer, scrambles beneath a console, her tools clattering. She emerges, wiping grease from her hands, her uniform a mix of engineer practicality and vibrant flair.
She notices a fluctuation on a panel and taps it, mumbling.
LUMINA
Let's hope this contraption can
handle all their hot air. Pryme, overhearing her, laughs heartily.
21.

PRYME
Lumina, Ready for another round
with our lovely Earth?
LUMINA (smirking)
Only if I get to choose the food. Last time, I learned way too much about how human digestion works... and works, and works.
VEGA
While the culinary adventures of
Earth are... enlightening, we should focus on learning from our past miscalculations.
EROS (threatened) Miscalculations!
VEGA
I merely suggest that we gather as
much data as possible to-
CRONOS
You want to make an immediate
change. Remove the whole idea of a "snooze button." Set a time, get up, go to work.
EROS
And while we're at it, why don't we
just have everyone wear exactly the same clothing?
CRONOS
Excellent idea! In fact, let's
ditch clothing altogether.
EROS
And what about population growth?
CRONOS
Fair enough, we must find a better
reproductive process. We need to make it less-
VEGA
I was simply suggesting-
PRYME
Ah, healthy brainstorming sessions.
22.

Suddenly, Quan materializes, her presence bringing a serene gravity to the room.
QUAN (musingly)
Every voice contributes to the symphony of existence. Dawn’s voice, might just be the harmony needed to tune our efforts.
Pryme, claps his hands, gathering everyone’s attention.
PRYME
Marvelous! Quan speaks truth! We
have a mission, and by the stars, we’ll boldly go where no one has gone before!
VEGA
But we have gone twice before.
PRYME
Third time's a charm. Lumina,
double-check those energy fluxes, please. Let’s show Dawn what we’re really made of!
VEGA
But we are all waves of light, we
simply take this particle form so that the humans-
LUMINA (saluting)
On it, Captain! Let’s show Dawn the time of her life!
Pryme looks out over the cosmos, his expression a mix of determination and childlike wonder. He gestures forward.
PRYME
Make haste! Nope. Ah... Tally-ho!
Ugh, beyond lame. Just go, again. The crew evaporates into light.
*** NEED A DAWN DECISION MOMENT SCENE
CUT TO BLACK.
23.

INT. CELESTIAL REALM - COMMAND CENTER - TIMELESS
The atmosphere in the command center buzzes with action as Pryme directs the crew with the flare of Gustavo Dudamel.
The scene opens to a flurry of activity. Holographic screens flicker with data and celestial maps. LUMINA multitasks frantically, adjusting dials and rerouting power feeds, her tools a blur of motion.
LUMINA (under her breath)
One day, I'll just beam myself into a vacation.
EROS and CRONOS are mid-argument, their voices rising over the clanging machinery.
EROS (passionately)
Humans want to believe they are logical creatures but we both know they are really just a bundle of emotions.
CRONOS
Exactly, emotions, first thing we
remove if we even allow humans on Earth3.0.
EROS
Come on, I caught you watching the
movie Wall Street.
CRONOS
Greed is good, greed is right,
greed works.
EROS
Seriously? That's your takeaway?
CRONOS (smirking)
It's a metaphor.
EROS
And we still wonder what went wrong
with Earth2.0?
VEGA
No need to wonder.
24.

A collage of images fill the wall showing the challenges earth faces today. Unrest, pollution, poverty, hunger, etc. all pulse setting an ominous tone.
LUMINA
And you wonder why we don't invite
you to our parties.
Dawn strides in confidently. Dawn sports a new outfit that's a cross between futuristic sleekness and a '60s flair, her hair in Princess Leia curls. She pauses, taking in the dour scene as her expression changes.
DAWN
There's no place like home.
PRYME Vega! Reset.
DAWN (declaring)
Alright, team, Celeste, I mean, Schrödinger and I are in. We'll help you build a better Earth for one week. All we ask in exchange is more of that amazing food and a paltry billion dollars, annually.
Pryme beams with delight, clapping his hands enthusiastically.
PRYME
Splendid! That’s the spirit! With
Dawn on board, Earth3.0 will truly be a masterpiece!
The team applauds, caught up in the moment of unity and excitement.
DAWN
I was serious about the
compensation.
PRYME (ignoring Dawn)
Which brings us to our new initiative!
Pryme gestures enthusiastically to a holographic interface displaying various Earth celebrities and intellectuals.
25.

PRYME (CONT'D) (energetically)
We'll learn directly from earth’s most influential minds! Think of it, the brightest, the best, right here! Helping us shape a perfect new world.
DAWN
You’re going to kidnap celebrities
to save the world?
PRYME (laughing)
Not kidnap, no! We invite them! It’s all very polite and consensual.
Vega activates a display showing a complex algorithm.
VEGA
We use a selection algorithm that
identifies individuals based on their impact on societal, environmental, and technological advancements. The process is designed to ensure a diverse representation of human excellence and creativity.
DAWN
And they just fly up here in their
private jets?
PRYME
What human wouldn’t want to
sacrifice a little and contribute to building a perfect world that serves all?
DAWN
Hope you have reams of list making
paper.
VEGA
No trees need be harmed.
DAWN
Who’s first on your cosmic Met Gala
guest list?
Pryme taps the display, and the profile of a well-known ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVIST appears, glowing softly.
26.

VEGA
Meet our first participant. They’ve
revolutionized how we think about sustainable living on earth.
Dawn looks at the profile, her skepticism slowly turning into intrigue.
Pryme claps his hands excitedly, eager to dive into the details.
PRYME
Prepare for the beam up process!
LUMINA Ay Captain!
DAWN
What happened to the willing
subject part?
PRYME
We'll explain it all to them once
they arrive?
DAWN
You have a lot to learn about the
word "consent."
PRYME
And that's why you're here. Places
people! Three minutes to go time.
Vega rehearses, speaking into a recording device, refining his speech algorithm with each iteration.
VEGA (rehearsing)
Welcome, esteemed guest. Your presence here unravels a pivotal stitch in the tapestry of our new world.
Dawn chuckles at Vega’s formality.
DAWN
You planning to roll out the red
carpet too, or is that too Hollywood for Cronos?
Vega pauses, considering, then adds to his notes.
27.

VEGA
Note: Possibly include a red carpet
in the beaming protocol.
Lumina calls out from under a console, needing a hand.
LUMINA
Could use an extra pair of hands.
Dawn strides over, kneeling beside Lumina to help tighten some bolts. Lumina grabs Dawn's hand and gives a firm shake.
LUMINA (CONT'D) Lumina, nice to meet you.
DAWN And I'm. Dawn.
LUMINA
Yup, read your entire file. You got
some fire in you girl.
DAWN (joking)
Hey, how many higher beings does it take to tighten a bolt?
LUMINA
One, the rest are too busy debating
the theory of rotation to actually do the spinning.
They share a laugh, bonding over the task.
PRYME (interrupting)
Dawn, join us please. We’re about to welcome our first earthly guest.
LUMINA
Go for it ambassador.
Dawn wipes her hands on her pants, joining Pryme at the main console. She approvingly shakes her head at the choice.
PRYME
(pointing at the screen)
Whom better to start with than someone who’s both a planet hero and a household name?
Cronos rolls his eyes, while Eros nods approvingly.
28.

PRYME (CONT'D)
Dawn, I would like you to make
first contact.
VEGA But-
DAWN
That's a metaphor, right? I didn't
shave my legs.
VEGA
Sir, may I suggest-
PRYME
Dawn is the right man, I mean woman
for the job.
Pryme claps his hands, a signal to begin the beaming process. Lumina rushes to finalize the settings, her efficiency a stark contrast to the bickering.
PRYME (CONT'D)
I'm ready for my close up. Get the
double meaning because we are meeting close up and they are a big star like-
LUMINA
Got it! Calibrating for extra ego.
And...we’re a go!
PRYME
One small step for Man-
EROS Ahem!
PRYME
One small step for humankind. One
giant leap for-
Lumina pushes the BEAM UP button.
The team gathers around as the beaming technology whirs to life. The machine starts to shake and smoke causing concern. Lumina kicks it and the machine purrs with perfection.
Lights swirl as the room glows. Dawn watches, a mix of fear and curiosity in her eyes.
CUT TO WHITE.
29.

INT. CELESTIAL REALM - BEAMING CHAMBER - TIMELESS
A futuristic chamber, bathed in soft, pulsing lights. The Higher Beings gather around a platform, their excitement palpable.
A beam of light coalesces into a human form, then suddenly shatters into wave fractals of light. All gasp! Lumina springs into action flipping switches and twisting dials.
The light shards start to reform as Lumina works frantically.
DAWN
Did this happen to me?
SCHRÖDINGER Ignorance is bliss.
Lumina pulls a big lever as the light merges into the form of a CELEBRITY, who appears disoriented but unharmed.
Pryme nods to Dawn. She hesitantly steps forward.
DAWN Greetings earthling.
CELEBRITY
Again? Please, this time can I take
a selfie or maybe at least some proof that-
DAWN (comforting)
No. We're not aliens. I mean, at least I'm not. And these are...my new friends.
The Higher Beings look touched.
DAWN (CONT'D)
I don't know exactly what they are
but it includes quantum something and-
CELEBRITY
I knew it! Which alternate reality
am I in?
Vega materializes way too close to the celebrity. Freaking them out.
VEGA
If I may decipher-
30.

CELEBRITY
Can I go back to my universe
please?
Pryme jumps in pulling out a beautifully bound book. He opens a page and removes a quill pen from his back pocket.
PRYME
We are all quite honored by your
presence. May I ask that you please sign my Captain's log and make sure to include the star date.
Pryme puts the pen in the CELEBRITY's hand and places the book in front of them.
DAWN
Is that a galactic autograph book?
SCHRÖDINGER Only the beginning.
PRYME
The name's Pryme in case you want
to personalize, from one leader to another.
Dawn, steps forward with a reassuring smile.
DAWN
You may feel a bit woozy, but it’ll
pass. Happens to the best of us. Can someone please get a glass of water for our guest?
CELEBRITY (bewildered)
Sparkling, with a lime, peeled, please. Where...am I?
Schrödinger, saunters over, offering a calming purr.
DAWN
Think of this as a weird, but very
exclusive backstage.
CELEBRITY And all of this is...?
Vega, interrupting, steps forward with a clipboard.
31.

VEGA
For the betterment of earth! Let us
now commence with the data acquisition. First inquiry—
Cronos, unexpectedly cordial, cuts in, a stark contrast to his usual demeanor, runs in with a glass of water.
CRONOS
Before that, can I just say how
much we all admire your work in film. Truly, it's an honor.
Eros, blushing, nods in agreement.
CELEBRITY Thank you, I hope.
Vega, persistent, tries to redirect the conversation.
VEGA
Now regarding your planetary
initiatives, we need a list of the top 10 solutions ranked in ascending order by propensity and-
While Vega is speaking, Pryme pulls out a futuristic looking device and stands next to the celebrity. He places the device between them and snaps what looks like a photo.
PRYME Smile!
CELEBRITY
Would you like me to sign that as
well?
VEGA
No need, he just captured your
entire DNA sequence, memories and contact lists.
CELEBRITY Anything else?
DAWN
Ignorance is bliss. Here, come take
a seat.
PRYME Please take my chair.
Dawn leads our celebrity to Pryme's chair.
32.

VEGA
We will now start collecting the
required information.
The celebrity looks bewildered. Dawn sits next to them.
DAWN
Look. These, whatever they are, are
trying to make earth better and they are interested in your-
CELEBRITY
I get it, they want me to purchase
a table to their upcoming gala.
VEGA No! Why would we-
DAWN
They simply want to hear more about
your vision and your approach to save our planet.
Really?
CELEBRITY
ALL Really!
CELEBRITY
Ok, and I don't even need to make a
cameo for their passion project?
PRYME
Now that you mention it-
DAWN
No! We just want to hear from you.
CELEBRITY
Well then, ok, sure...ah...um
CRONOS
What seems to be the problem?
CELEBRITY Ah...nothing...it's just that I
usually play my video now.
Lumina flips a switch and the back wall becomes a projection screen. A short VIDEO plays of the celebrity introducing their cause. The projection switches to a PPT DECK and CLICKER appears in the celebrity's hand.
33.

Lumina tinkers with some more equipment and the room fills with 3D examples of the presentation's inspirational glory.
CELEBRITY (CONT'D)
Wow, amazing work. Can I bring you
to all my presentations?
Lumina, surprised and flattered, gives a small, proud smile.
LUMINA
Thanks for the offer, but they need
me here.
VEGA Please proceed!
Dawn gives a comforting nod and the celebrity begins the presentation.
In this section we customize based on the celebrity and use the latest TECHNOLOGY, AI, XR, Etc. To demonstrate the positive use of emerging options and solution. When watching in XR we will have bonuses and easter eggs.
The celebrity discusses their journey, the impact of their work, and the pressures of public life. Pryme asks naive but earnest questions about fame and responsibility.
Dawn mediates, translating Vega's technical jargon and high- concept questions into relatable terms.
Vega takes notes, intrigued by the human capacity for emotional depth and resilience. Cronos and Eros each try to validate their points and the celebrity finds common ground that they can all accept with the help of Dawn.
Lumina discusses the engineering side of the proposed solutions, adding light technical humor.
FADE TO BLACK. INT. CELESTIAL REALM - BEAMING CHAMBER - TIMELESS
The Higher Beings and Dawn cluster around the stands at the center, bathed in the soft glow lights.
PRYME
(with genuine admiration)
Much appreciation for sharing your vision and passion. Enlightening and inspiring! Until we meet again.
celebrity, who of the chamber
34.

Pryme's shakes the celebrity's hand then gives them a hug that lasts too long.
DAWN (to Lumina)
Do you guys have HR up here?
Lumina laughs and breaks up the moment. She places a band around the celebrity's head.
Are you longer?
As much to keep
CELEBRITY
sure I can’t stay a bit
CRONOS
as we'd love that, we need things...tidy. Right, Vega?
VEGA
Precisely. We must ensure the
integrity of your timeline.
Vega reveals a device that emits a gentle, humming sound.
VEGA (CONT'D) (softly)
Merely a brief respite. Upon awakening, you shall recall a delightful dream, nothing more, nothing less.
CELEBRITY
Oh, can you make it the dream where
I'm wearing-
The light from the device envelops the celebrity, who closes their eyes and slowly fades, beaming back to earth. The room grows quiet, the team reflecting on the encounter.
LUMINA
(checking her equipment)
And...they’re back. Safe and sound.
EXT. CALIFORNIA HOLLYWOOD SIGN - CONTINUOUS The celebrity sits atop the HOLLYWOOD SIGN.
CELEBRITY A little help here?
35.

INT. CELESTIAL REALM - BEAMING CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
PRYME (clapping his hands)
Marvelous! What an opening! Humans, so wonderful, yet so painfully lost.
VEGA (thoughtful)
Indeed. Their passions are intricately multifaceted, intertwined with their most fervent aspirations and profoundest fears.
DAWN (With ease)
Yes, humans, quite complex, yet simple.
As they ponder, Quan materializes startling dawn.
QUAN
And so the process begins.
Pryme claps his hands and champagne glasses appear.
PRYME
I raise a toast to our new friend,
companion and champion of Earth3.0. Here's to Dawn,
The team applauds and clinks glasses. Dawn uncomfortably smiles and clinks her glass. She motions to Pryme asking if she can speak with him alone.
PRYME (CONT'D)
What can I do for my new favorite
earthling?
DAWN
I still can't fathom why...me?
PRYME
There was once a young Rangifer
tarandus, unique among its peers. It possessed a luminescent feature, often mocked by others. They focused on what set it apart, rather than its latent potential.
Dawn looks at him blankly.
36.

PRYME (CONT'D) Then one foggy-
DAWN
Wait, are you saying I'm Rudolph?
PRYME
One of the best holiday flicks ever
created. Right from the beginning you are rooting for-
CRONOS
The Bumble, so misunderstood.
EROS
Clarice's song! Breaks your heart.
LUMINA
I gotta say, Herbie's my man.
DAWN
But the other reindeer are jerks
until they need Rudolph. And, I thought we were having a private conversation.
CRONOS
We hear everything, everywhere all
at once. Dawn shakes her head.
VEGA
I prefer It's a Wonderful
Life.
PRYME
What happened to the mood, we just
nailed it. Raise another glass to our little Rudolph, Dawn.
As the celebration reaches its peak, Schrödinger enters, his expression serious. The cheer fades into a tense silence. Schrödinger turns to Vega, his eyes narrowing.
Vega!
SCHRÖDINGER
VEGA Yes sir.
SCHRÖDINGER
When were you planning on sharing
your FULL plans?
*
37.

VEGA, caught off-guard, hesitates. The others look at Vega, confusion turning to concern.
VEGA
Upon rigorous analysis, the Higher
Higher beings and I determined-
DAWN
Higher Higher, you guys are middle
management?
VEGA
We concluded that this should be
strictly on a need-to-know basis.
LUMINA I need to know!
VEGA
I regret that I-
LUMINA
Then I regret that I'm cutting your
power.
Lumina reaches to a conduit that powers Vega.
PRYME
Enough. As your captain I command
you to reveal your grand plan.
VEGA
Shall we converse in private?
PRYME
As a team we live and die together.
CRONOS
I prefer, the captain goes down
with the ship.
DAWN
Plus, you guys already hear
everything anyway.
PRYME (with force)
Spill it Vega!
*
38.

VEGA (reluctantly)
Our calculations incontrovertibly indicate that, to guarantee success, that upon the finalization of the blueprint for Earth3.0, Earth2.0 must be...decommissioned.
A gasp echoes through the command center.
DAWN (stunned)
Define decommissioned.
Destroyed!
SCHRÖDINGER
Vega nods solemnly. PRYME and the others are visibly shocked, not having been privy to this drastic decision.
PRYME (outraged)
Destroyed! No way!
VEGA (firmly)
It unequivocally proves the sole viable method to assure that Earth3.0 flourish.
Eros and Cronos exchange worried glances, the weight of Vega's words sinking in. Lumina looks distraught.
SCHRÖDINGER (to Dawn)
I assure you, this is not what I agreed upon when I took on this mission. Dear Dawn, I can wipe your memory, make this all go away, and send you home should you choose.
Stunned, Dawn stares down upon Earth2.0 in disbelief.
The camera slowly pushes in on Dawn’s face, her eyes reflecting a mix of fear, determination, and a hint of rebellion.
CUT TO BLACK.
